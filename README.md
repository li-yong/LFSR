# LFSR
An efficient linear feedback shift register (LFSR) class in C++

To build the sample : **g++ -std=c++11 LFSR.cpp main.cpp -o lfsr**

Output of the sample is : **counter = 16383**

----------------------------------------

LFSR can be used to generate pseudorandom numbers but it's possible to use it to play music. In a lot of case, the system will produce noise but, in some cases, the system will produce interesting tones.
